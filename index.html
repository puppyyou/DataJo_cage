            <span class="firstcharacter">H</span>ow did Nicolas Cage's internet persona become bigger than the actor himself? Nic Cage is famous for taking pretty much any and every role. He was in 65 movies so far (2014). Face Off, Lord of War, Leaving Las Vegas, Wild at heart, Moonstruck... it's understandable that some people think his movie as tacky or even pointless. But you have to admit his movie is rarely boring. If so, is that the reason he became a living meme ? What really happend to him ?

          </p>

      <div class="text">
        <p>What sounds like a classic Cage impression? Another talented guy from the Coppola family ? A movie star who is all over the place ? Is he the worst movie star ever? Or maybe he is the worst but the best movie star ever? Because you despise some of his movies but he is so likable in the other one. This is Nicolas Cage, at 50. He was in 65 movies so far. He is been difficult to place all the time. Moving between different genres, styles and getting variety rating. </p>


          <p> 

           Nicolas Cage(1964 - Present) started his career in the 1980’s. According to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/nicolas_cage/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the lowest film review he received was 0% from DEADFALL in 1993. Alternatively, the highest rating he received was 95% for RED ROCK WEST, which is in 1993 as well. In 1995, he was awarded his first Oscar for LEAVING LAS VEGAS. Due to financial problems in 2007, Cage has unfortunately had to accept varying roles in order to pay off his debts. However this is not a new practice for him; he has always being considered an actor with variety ratings . According from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/20/nicolas-cage-frozen-ground">the Guardian</a>, "I'm one of those Americans who believes in working. If you've made mistakes in the past, you don't just roll over on people or cave in, you find a way through it. But in film acting, for some reason you get criticised for working.”

         We can see from the chart below, he is at least in one movie since 1989 to 2015. 26 year past, some of them received incredibly high rating, some of them received really low one. The average rating he had is 50.76%. Let’s look at other actors of his generation. Tom Cruise(1962- Present)was in 44 movies, the average rating he received is 63.52%; Brad Pitt (1962- Present) was in 42 movies, the average rating he received is 64.07%. They are both have higher average rating than Cage, and was in less movies than Cage. So is that the reason people start making things about him ? Because he was in too much movies and overly acting? I would put it this way, it's because his star persona make the internet loves him. All the castles he purchased; how he blow his money; his weird look, the sad face and his beyond the so-bad-it's-good level. His real life story behind the movies is as exciting as his movies. The internet loves to embrace awkwardness and controversy. That's why the internet chosen him and developed things about him.
