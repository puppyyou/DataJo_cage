            <span class="firstcharacter">H</span>ow did Nicolas Cage's internet persona become bigger than the actor himself? Nic Cage is famous for taking pretty much any and every role offered to him. His filmography spans 65 movies so far (as of 2014). Face Off, Lord of War, Leaving Las Vegas, Wild at heart, Moonstruck... it's understandable some people find his movie tacky or contrived. But his movies are rarely boring. If he is indeed never boring even in bad films, is that why he became such a popular meme ? What happened to Nic Cage when the internet became as we know it today ?

      <div class="text">
        <p>Who is the Nic Cage we have all come to know? Yet another talented member of the Coppola family ? A rogue actor whose role selection is as befuddled as the quirky characters he portrays? Is he the worst movie star ever? Or maybe he is the worst good actor ever? Nic Cage is so hard define because just when you thought his latest movie cannot possibly get any tackier, he does a 180 in his next film and pulls you right back in with a knockout performance.

          <p> 


            This is Nicolas Cage, at age 50. He has been in 65 movie productionss so far. His body of work is difficult to define - spanning across genres, styles and critical reception.
            Nicolas Cage(1964 - Present) started his career in the 1980’s. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest aggregated film rating for which his film received was 0% for DEADFALL in 1993. Alternatively, his highest rated film- he received was 95% for RED ROCK WEST- (which was released in 1993 as well.) In 1995, he was awarded his first Oscar for the leading role in LEAVING LAS VEGAS. Due to financial problems in 2007, Cage was driven to accept a mix bag of roles in order to pay off his debts. However, this type of actor-for-hire gig is not a new practice for him; Cage has always been being considered a prolific actor of flexibility. Cage once described himself to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/20/nicolas-cage-frozen-ground">the Guardian</a>,: "I’m one of those Americans who believes in working. If you've made mistakes in the past, you don't just roll over on people or cave in, you find a way through it. But in film acting, for some reason you get criticised for working.”

         We can see from the chart below, he has been in at least one movie from 1989 to 2015. Throughout his 26-year career, some films received incredibly high rating, while others were brutally panned by the critics to receive a 0% rating. The average rating for all his films is 50.76%. Compare it to other notable actors of his generation: Tom Cruise (1962- Present) was in 44 movies, with the average rating of 63.52%, while- Brad Pitt (1962- Present) acted in 42 movies- with the average rating of 64.07%. Both actors have so far enjoyed what you can say are more critically acclaimed careers than Cage, and and they were in significantly less movies than Cage. In the end, what is the main reason people start making things about him ? Because he was in too much movies and overly acting? I would put it this way, it's because his star persona make the internet loves him. All the castles he purchased; how he blow his money; his weird look, the sad face and his beyond the so-bad-it's-good level. His real life story behind the movies is as exciting as his movies. The internet loves to embrace awkwardness and controversy. That's why the internet chosen him and developed things about him.
